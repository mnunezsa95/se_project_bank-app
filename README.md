### Intro - About the project

The Bank App enables users to log in with their username and pin (refer to the credentials section for demo credentials). Upon login, the user's financial information is presented in a sleek and simple format, showcasing their latest deposits and withdrawals. Users can then choose from various actionable options, including transferring money to another account, requesting a loan, or closing their account.

In the case of money transfers, users have the capability to transfer funds to another user's account (refer to the credentials section for demo credentials).

### Description of the Project

The project was constructed solely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary approach employed for functionality involved manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). This method is chosen because most of the manipulations are small in scale, ensuring a swift response from the browser to any changes.

The project concept, design and starter code (HTML & CSS) were created by Jonas Schmedtmann (twitter/x). Jonas Schmedtmann is the copyright owner of this concept. The JavaScript portion of this project was written by Marlon Nunez when following along 2 hours of video in the The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert course from Udemy.

### Plans for Improvement

1. Backend Element
   Currently, the project is exclusively developed on the frontend. A significant enhancement involves establishing a backend component to enable users to create their own accounts. This feature would enable users to view all recent transactions when revisiting the application.
